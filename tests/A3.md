# A3: Endpoint and Fault Tolerance Testing

This document outlines the steps for manually testing the functionality of the load balancer's API endpoints and its fault-tolerance mechanism.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the application stack is running. If not, start it using the Makefile:

```bash
make up
```

---

### Part 1: Testing API Endpoints

These tests verify that the load balancer correctly handles adding, removing, and listing server replicas.

**1. Check Initial Replica Status**

[cite\_start]Verify that the load balancer starts with the default `N=3` replicas[cite: 29, 70].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/rep
  ```

- **Expected Output:**

  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "N": 3,
      "replicas": ["server-0", "server-1", "server-2"]
    },
    "status": "successful"
  }
  ```

**2. Add New Server Instances (Scale Up)**

[cite\_start]Add two new server instances[cite: 93].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"n": 2, "hostnames": ["new-server-1", "new-server-2"]}' http://localhost:5000/add
  ```

- **Expected Output:** The system will now have `N=5` replicas.

  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "N": 5,
      "replicas": [
        "server-0",
        "server-1",
        "server-2",
        "new-server-1",
        "new-server-2"
      ]
    },
    "status": "successful"
  }
  ```

**3. Remove Server Instances (Scale Down)**

[cite\_start]Remove two specified server instances[cite: 119].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"n": 2, "hostnames": ["server-0", "new-server-2"]}' http://localhost:5000/rm
  ```

- **Expected Output:** The system will return to `N=3` replicas.

  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "N": 3,
      "replicas": ["server-1", "server-2", "new-server-1"]
    },
    "status": "successful"
  }
  ```

**4. Test Request Routing**

Send a request to the `/home` endpoint. [cite\_start]It should be successfully routed to an active server[cite: 144, 145].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/home
  ```

- **Expected Output (Example):**

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Hello from Server: server-1",
    "status": "successful"
  }
  ```

**5. Test Invalid Endpoint**

[cite\_start]Requesting an endpoint not registered with the web servers should result in an error[cite: 147].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/invalid-path
  ```

- **Expected Output:**

  ```json
  {
    "message": "<Error> '/invalid-path' endpoint does not exist in server replicas",
    "status": "failure"
  }
  ```

---

### Part 2: Testing Fault Tolerance

[cite\_start]This test verifies that the load balancer can detect a server failure and spawn a new instance to maintain the required number of replicas (`N`)[cite: 39, 82, 163].

**1. List Running Containers**

First, identify the running server containers.

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **Expected Output:** You should see the load balancer and the active server replicas.

**2. Manually Stop a Server**

[cite\_start]Simulate a server failure by stopping one of the server containers[cite: 27].

- **Command (Example):**
  ```bash
  docker stop server-1
  ```

**3. Wait for Health Check**

[cite\_start]The load balancer's health check runs periodically to identify failures[cite: 62]. Wait for this interval to pass.

**4. Verify Server Respawn**

Check the running containers again. [cite\_start]The load balancer should have detected the failure and spawned a new container to replace the one that was stopped[cite: 24, 39].

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **Expected Result:** You will see that the `server-1` container is running again (note its new container ID and uptime).

**5. Confirm Replica Status**

[cite\_start]Query the `/rep` endpoint again to ensure the load balancer's internal state is consistent and still reports the correct number of active replicas[cite: 84].

- **Command:**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:5000/rep
  ```

- **Expected Output:** The replica list should be updated, but `N` should be the same as before the failure.

  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "N": 3,
      "replicas": ["server-2", "new-server-1", "server-1"]
    },
    "status": "successful"
  }
  ```

[cite\_start]This confirms that the load balancer correctly handles server failures and maintains system stability[cite: 163].

```

```
